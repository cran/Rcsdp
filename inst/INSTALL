R interface to CSDP semidefinite programming library
 
Upon installation, the bundled CSDP code is built and linked, otherwise the user can supply
the location of the csdp installation directory. The three ways to install this package are

1) By default the bundled CSDP code is used:

R CMD INSTALL <Rcsdp tar ball>


2) Otherwise, the user can provide the location of the csdp installation directory

R CMD INSTALL --configure-args="--with-csdp=<location of csdp DIR>" <Rcsdp tar ball>

Compiler flags for csdp can be given using --with-csdp-cflags as part of --configure-args
